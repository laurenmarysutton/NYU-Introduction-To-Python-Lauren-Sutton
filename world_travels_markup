My game is called the Amazing Race.

Ojbective:
The objective of the game is to complete a journey around the world starting in New York City then traveling to Reykjavik, 
then traveling to Paris, then traveling to Moscow, then traveling to Beijing, then arriving back in New York City.

Instructions:
The user will play the game by answering a series of trivia questions to move from one city to the next. 
If the user would like to quit the game at any time, the user is able to do so.

Approach:
Created a series of functions for each question in the game, a function for the game instructions, a function that enables 
the user to quit, and the main function to call all of the questions. Formatted the responses and then used a series of 
conditional statements to print a response to the user as to whether or not he/she got the answer correct. If the user 
incorrectly answers a question, the user will be exited from the game. If the user answers correctly, he/she will be notified. 
If the user provides a response that is invalid, the user will be prompted to respond to the question again.
