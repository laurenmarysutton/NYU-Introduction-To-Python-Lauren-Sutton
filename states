<h3>States using python</h3>

Is there another data structure that can solve this problem? What worked about this approach? What didn't work?

Rather than using an html list of options for the user to select from, a python function can be written that includes a loop. This is a better approach because the code length is shorter, cleaner, and easier to read than having to scroll through a long html list.
